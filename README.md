ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with MobileNetV2. The primary goal is to automate tumor detection to assist radiologists and improve diagnostic efficiency. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of brain MRI scans, with images categorized as either "tumor" or "no tumor".
We explore both a custom CNN architecture and a MobileNetV2-based approach to compare performance and optimize accuracy.

The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload an MRI image and receive instant predictions along with confidence scores.
